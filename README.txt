Installation
Clone the repository:

bash

git clone https://github.com/kirsanov69/Telegram-Bot-for-Avito-Call-Statistics.git
cd Telegram-Bot-for-Avito-Call-Statistics      
Install dependencies:

export BOT_TOKEN="your-telegram-bot-token"
export DATABASE_URL="your-database-url"
Setup the database (PostgreSQL or SQLite can be used):

bash

python setup_db.py
Bot Commands
/start - Start the bot and display the welcome message.
/token <your_avito_token> - Add your Avito API token for tracking statistics.
üìä –ü–æ–∫–∞–∑–∞—Ç—å —Å—Ç–∞—Ç–∏—Å—Ç–∏–∫—É - Fetch and display statistics for all your Avito ads.

API Structure
The bot communicates with the Avito API to fetch data on the user's listings and their respective call statistics:

Listings Endpoint: https://api.avito.ru/core/v1/items
Call Stats Endpoint: https://api.avito.ru/core/v1/accounts/{user_id}/calls/stats
The statistics include:

answered: Answered calls
calls: Total calls
new: New calls
newAnswered: New and answered calls
Running the Bot
Run the bot locally:

bash

python webhook.py
You can also set up the bot to work with a webhook for more efficient communication:

bash

python setup_webhook.py
Docker Support
This project is fully containerized using Docker.

Building and Running the Docker Container:
Build the Docker image:

bash

docker-compose build
Run the bot using Docker Compose:

bash

docker-compose up
This will set up both the bot and the database inside Docker containers, enabling easy deployment.

Testing Mode
The bot includes a testing mode for development purposes, allowing you to simulate Avito API responses with mock data. To enable the test mode, simply set the environment variable:

bash

export TEST_MODE=True
In testing mode, the bot will return predefined statistics, useful for testing interaction without needing real API access.

Future Enhancements
Add support for other marketplaces.
Implement advanced report filters (e.g., time range).
Provide options to export reports in additional formats (e.g., CSV, PDF).
